# My Arch Dotfiles

* V_Previous is the previous version for backup
* V_Current is the installed version
* 'V_next' is for future changes.
* 'Wallpapers' dir in root contains additional wallpapers that can be copied over after installation of a version. This folder is kept separate to keep the repo size small.
* Read the README files in individual folders for instruction on installation of that version.
